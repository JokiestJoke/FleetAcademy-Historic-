*** Note to reader ***
This version of FleetAcademy is what I will refer to as historic. I consider this project as historic as I am moving my efforts on to another project of the same name built in Unity versus Phaser.js. Why have I made this historic? Here are a few reasons:
	
	1) The major issue with this project was that it was built on the Phaser.js game engine. While fantastic for small arcade games, there are certain limitations 		that Phaser.js games have versus games built in other game engines. In other words, other game engines pack a lot more punch than Phaser.js. Not only that, 
	 but there is more support for Unity and Unreal engines that make them more viable of an option versus Phaser.js.
	
	2) When I started this project, I was mainly self taught in OOP. I had some self taught experience in Javascript and Python. On reflection, what I am currently 	capable of versus what I was capable of before schooling is quite stark. Since the creation of this project I have learned and consitently practiced C, C#, 	    and Java. Not only that, but I have studied many gang of four design patterns. Rather than attempting to overhaul this project in Phaser.js with new knowledge, 	    I decided the best approach would be to find a new game engine to build the future of Fleet Academy with a clean slate. That being said none of my original 	styles or wishes for this game have changed. I am fully committed to completing this project with a tabula rasa.
	
	3) While I still code in Javascript, I am much better versed in C, C#, and Java. There is a particulare logic and style to these langauges that I personally
	love and I beleive I can leverage C# in Unity's game editor in a more clean and professional manner.
	

So why keep this project up? Well for me atleast it is a reminder of how far I have come. On a re-read of this code, I see many things I would refactor, clean, and generally make more legible. I also leave this project up for any reader or future employers to see where I started and where I am now with my recent projects. So please, I invite you to come check out my newest attempt at creating the game Fleet Academy built in the Unity Engine. I believe you will see more professional code that uses many design patterns to accomplish a coherent game. 

Thank you for your time,

Mark Doghramji

Original ReadME is as follows:

Fleet Academy:

So what will Fleet Academy be?

Fleet Academy currently is a HTML game made with phaser. While the game is not in a full running state,
development is always active! Fleet Academy will offer turn based fleet combat, and is heavily influenced by starship troopers,
Pokemon, and other JRPG elements. 

Key Features:


Single Player:
	
	1) Main Objectives: The main objective of this project, is to use JavaScript, HTML, and Phaser.js to create a cohesive game. My hopes is to one day 
	publish this game on the web for free.

	2) Influences: I just want to say outloud that the influences of this game are as follows: 
	Asthetics: Starship Troopers
	Gameplay: Pokemon
	Story: Original and clumsy.

	3) Main Story: The main story will be a small single player experience. Currently, there are 5 levels planned and all of this is hinged on the fact that
	I will be able to store all this data in an HTML game. The player will take control of a young student, enrolled in the `Imperium Galacticum` Fleet Academy.
	This is your first day of fleet academy, and you will compete with other students to earn the title of 'Lord Among Admirals'. Students will engage in simulated 
	stellar combat between contigents of other student's fleets. Much like a pokemon trainer fights other trainers to be the victor of the Elite four. 
		-> World Historical Setting TBA.

	4) Save/Load game files: I read this is a possible feature in Phaser.js built games. However, I personally have no experience in this. Production in this feature
	may come last depending on my abillity to understand the depth of what is needed to save a game!



This will be updated as features are added and ideas become more specific. In the meantime, Fly Safe out there Cadets! o7!
